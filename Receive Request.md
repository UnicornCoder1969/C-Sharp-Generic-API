# Feedback Process for Prototype Evaluation

## Technical Audience

### 1. Introduction to the Prototype:
- I will begin by introducing the prototype to the technical audience and ask them to interact with it. The goal is to familiarize them with the product, its features, and its functions. This will allow them to experience how the app is intended to work and its overall usability.

### 2. Observation:
- While the technical users interact with the prototype, I will carefully observe their interactions. I will pay attention to:
  - Which features they engage with first.
  - How they navigate through the app.
  - Any challenges or confusion they experience.
  - What works intuitively for them, and what does not.
  
- This observation is crucial for understanding any potential usability issues and identifying areas of improvement.

### 3. Code Review:
- After the user has had time to interact with the prototype, I will show them the source code behind the prototype. This is a critical part of the feedback process, as the technical users will be able to assess the quality of the code and provide insights from a developer’s perspective.
- I will ask them to fill out a form with the following questions:
  - How clean and readable is the code?
  - Have best practices or design patterns been applied?
  - Are there any sections of the code that seem inefficient, overly complex, or could be improved?
  - Are there any bugs or issues in the code that they notice?

### 4. Question Type:
- Due to the nature of code reviews and questions, many of the questions the developers get asked will be close-ended. However, I will also ask the technical audience the same questions as the non-technical audience. This will help improve future iterations by ensuring the design appeals to both types of users.

### 5. Documentation:
- All feedback from the technical users will be documented thoroughly in a document titled `Feedback.docx`. This will serve as a detailed record of their insights, critiques, and suggestions.
- The responses gathered will also be used for Task 3b in the project evaluation process. This means that the feedback will not only help to refine the prototype but will also be crucial for evaluating the project’s development from a technical perspective.

## Non-Technical Audience

### 1. Introduction to the Prototype:
- I will begin by introducing the prototype to the non-technical audience and ask them to interact with it. The goal is to familiarize them with the product, its features, and its functions. This will allow them to experience how the app is intended to work and its overall usability.

### 2. Functionality Assessment:
- I will ask non-technical users a set of questions related to the core functionality of the app. The questionnaire will focus on:
  - The perceived usefulness of the features.
  - How well the app meets their needs or solves a problem they may have.
  - Whether they experienced any issues when using the app (e.g., bugs, difficulties in performing tasks).
  - Their overall experience with the functionality: Did the app do what they expected? Were there any surprises?

### 3. Feature Enhancement:
- After they have explored the app’s functionality, I will ask them what additional features they would like to see added. This could include:
  - New functionalities they feel would improve the app's usefulness.
  - Features that would enhance the overall user experience or add value.
  - Ideas for improving the app’s existing features (e.g., more customization options, better integration with other tools).

### 4. User Interface and Usability:
- After the functionality section, I will shift focus to the app's look and usability. This will include:
  - **Colour Scheme:** How does the app’s colour palette make them feel? Is it visually appealing or distracting? Does it suit the purpose of the app?
  - **Navigation:** Is the navigation intuitive and easy to understand? Are users able to find the features they are looking for without difficulty?
  - **Accessibility:** Does the app cater to users with varying abilities? Is the text legible, are there colour contrast considerations, and is the app easy to navigate with screen readers or other assistive technologies?
  - **General Aesthetic Appeal:** Is the design modern and attractive? Does it match the expectations for the type of app it is?

### 5. Look and Feel Feedback:
- I will then ask non-technical users for detailed feedback on their overall experience with the app’s look and usability. Some potential questions could be:
  - What do you like most about the app’s design and interface?
  - Are there any aspects of the design or navigation that you find confusing or frustrating?
  - Do you feel the app is user-friendly? Why or why not?
  - How would you rate the app’s visual appeal (colours, fonts, layout)?
  - Are there any suggestions for making the app easier to use or more visually appealing?

### 6. Documentation and Analysis:
- As with the technical audience, I will document all feedback from the non-technical users in the `Feedback.docx` document. This feedback will include both the functional insights and the suggestions for design and usability improvements.
- This will also be used for Task 3b of the project evaluation, helping to understand the app’s reception from the perspective of the general users who are not involved in the technical development.

## Question Description

### Health Advice Group - Google Forms
- The Health Advice Group will use Google Forms for collecting user feedback. The form will include questions aimed at gathering insights into the functionality, usability, and overall experience with the app. It will be structured to provide valuable responses to help refine the product, both from a technical and non-technical perspective.
